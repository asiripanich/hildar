[HILDA survey data](https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/hilda) is quite large, with many columns and rows. Some waves have more than 5000 variables. The goal of this package is to provide a quick and easy way to quickly load HILDA data into your workspace by converting the datasets from `.dta`, (one of the three formats HILDA provides) to `.fst` which can be loaded much much quicker than `.dta` in R. The main function here is `hildar::hil_fetch()`, it can be used to load multiple years of hilda in one call and also allows a subset of variables to be selected. See `?fetch` for more options.

## 1) Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("asiripanich/hildar")
```

## 2) Store HILDA files as fst

Use `hil_setup(dir_input = "/path/to/your/hilda-stata-files", dir_output = "/path/to/save/hilda-fst-files")` to read in HILDA STATA (.dta) files and save them as `.fst` files for `hildar`. `.fst` is a binary data format that can be read very quickly, a lot faster than `.dta`.

## 3) Set `hildar.vault` R option

Let hildar knows where your `dir_output` is by setting `options(hildar.vault = "dir_output")`, alternatively you may provide the directory as the `.dir` argument in `fetch()`.

## Example

Here is how you can fetch HILDA data with `hildar`!

```{r}
library(hildar)

# fetch removes the HILDA year prefix from all the selected variable
# (e.g. axxx = 2001, bxxx = 2002).
fetch(years = 2001:2003, add_geography = T) %>%
  summary()
```

There is a quick option to add basic demographic variables to the data, which is set to TRUE by default.

```{r}
fetch(years = 2001, add_basic_vars = T) %>% 
  names()
```

How about doing a quick search to find variables that you want? Use `hil_dict` which is a data.table that you can search or view HILDA variables without going to their documentation webpage. 

```{r}
head(hil_dict)
```

Let say we want to select all variables that are related to 'employment' we can easily incorporate them into the `fetch()` function.

```{r}
emp_vars = hil_dict[grepl(pattern = "employment", label), var]
emp_vars
hilda_data = fetch(years = 2001:2003, vars = emp_vars)
dim(hilda_data)
```

Here is a summary of the dimensions of our HILDA data files.

```{r}
# the number of variables and rows in each wave
nrows_by_wave = 
  fetch(years = 2001:2016, add_basic_vars = F) %>%
  .[, .(number_of_rows = .N), by = wave]

hil_dict[, unlist(wave), by = .(var, label)] %>% 
  data.table::setnames("V1", "wave") %>%
  data.table::setDT() %>%
  .[, .(number_of_variables = .N), by = wave] %>%
  merge(nrows_by_wave, by = "wave")
```
