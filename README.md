<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **hildar** is to help R users that use HILDA survey data in
their works.

Please note that, this package doesnâ€™t include any parts of the HILDA
survey data. You must be authorised to have access to a release of HILDA
survey data.

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("asiripanich/hildar")
```

## Import HILDA files

Basically, this package imports HILDA survey data in .dta format (STATA
format) and convert them into .fst files so they can be accessed very
quickly\!

TODO: write an instruction on how to import HILDA files.

## Example

Here is how you fetch HILDA data\!

``` r
library(hildar)

hilda_data <- fetch(years = 2001:2016, add_geography = T)

summary(hilda_data)
