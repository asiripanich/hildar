HILDA survey data is quite large, with many columns and rows. Some waves
have more than 5000 variables. The goal of this package is to provide a
quick and easy way to quickly load HILDA data into your workspace by
converting the datasets from `.dta`, (one of the three formats HILDA
provides) to `.fst` which can be loaded much much quicker than `.dta` in
R. The main function here is `hildar::fetch()`, it can be used to load
multiple years of hilda in one call and also allows a subset of
variables to be selected. See `?fetch` for more options.

Please note that, this package doesnâ€™t include any parts of the HILDA
survey data. You must be authorised to have access to a release of HILDA
survey data.

## 1\) Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("asiripanich/hildar")
```

## 2\) Store HILDA files as fst

Use `setup_hildar(dir_input = "/path/to/your/hilda-stata-files",
dir_output = "/path/to/save/hilda-fst-files")` to read in HILDA STATA
(.dta) files and save them as `.fst` files for `hildar`. `.fst` is a
binary data format that can be read very quickly, a lot faster than
`.dta`.

## 3\) Set `hildar.vault` R option

Let hildar knows where your `dir_output` is by setting
`options(hildar.vault = "dir_output")`, alternatively you may provide
the directory as the `.dir` argument in `fetch()`.

## Example

Here is how you can fetch HILDA data with `hildar`\!

``` r
library(hildar)

# fetch removes the HILDA year prefix from all the selected variable
# (e.g. axxx = 2001, bxxx = 2002).
fetch(years = 2001:2003, add_geography = T) %>%
